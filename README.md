# Languages PW
A serial codes tests for studies (Java, C++, C, Python)

<b> Hello everybody </b>
I started for recently and I "publish" my "works" till ... No until

# Java, Python, C++, HTML
I learn languages for fun (and mathematics also)
If you want to check, help you with my works,
do not be shy. Also, there are no really copyrights
nor rules with all of that, you can use files as you want
But if it's for a something bad, I take no responsibility
(It'll be complicated with a print function)

My first big "project" is ... to make a cellphone menu
with all of its graphics, with Python it's so hard but with
Java, it's more understandable

I learn at this date English obviously and Java, Python, C++ and HTML
To debut, I think it'll be enough

Well ... By the way, who in the world read readme files?
Right, good exploration
